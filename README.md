Overwhelmed by your to-do list?  This Android app offers a unique solution:  introduce an element of chance to your task management. Simply add your tasks, assign weights based on their priority, and let the app randomly choose one for you to focus on. I built this app because I couldn't find anything similar, and it's been a simple yet effective way to overcome indecision and ensure I'm always working on something important. It has a basic design, but it gets the job done! 

Ready to take the guesswork out of your to-do list?
1. Add your tasks.
2. Assign weights to prioritize.
3. Tap "I Want a Task" and let the app decide what to tackle next!
